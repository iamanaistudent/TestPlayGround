Minimal static website for Selenium practice.

Files:
- `index.html` — Home page, includes "Show Message" button and right-click section
- `form.html` — Form page with Name and Email fields and client-side validation
- `table.html` — Table page with header and 5 rows
- `about.html` — Simple about page
- `styles.css` — Styling for pages
- `script.js` — Small JS for button, form validation, and context menu

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required).
2. Navigate to `Form` to test the form validation.
3. Navigate to `Table` to test reading table rows.
4. Right-click the "Right-Click Here" box to open the custom context menu.

Notes:
- All behavior is client-side (no backend).
- Designed to be simple and beginner-friendly for Selenium testing.
